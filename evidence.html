            <p>This section serves as Evan's curated "second brain," organizing insights from other sources. It will include evidence from Vienna housing, single-payer research from other countries, worker co-op success data, and more. Organized by similar topics as "My Analysis," this section focuses on synthesizing existing research and proven models.</p>

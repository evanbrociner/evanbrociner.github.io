        <p>Medicaid managed care should focus on developing predictive models to identify patients who will benefit most from care management and addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) like housing and food. It should invest in both medical and non-medical services for high-cost subgroups, involve consumers in program design to enhance engagement and meet community needs, and implement better predictive models and tailored interventions for super-utilizers. Effective strategies include structured follow-ups, preventive care, multidisciplinary teams, and data analytics. Integrated care approaches, such as those demonstrated by programs like CareMore, should be adopted to improve outcomes and cost-effectiveness by addressing social needs.

                  Active Redesign of a Medicaid Care Management Strategy for Greater Return on Investment: Predicting Impactability</a>
              </td>
              <td>
                Care management of high-cost/high-needs patients is an increasingly common strategy to reduce health care costs. A variety of targeting methodologies have emerged to identify patients with high historical or predicted health care utilization, but the more pertinent question for program planners is how to identify those who are most likely to benefit from care management intervention. This paper describes the evolution of complex care management targeting strategies in Community Care of North Carolinaâs (CCNC) work with the statewide non-dual Medicaid population, culminating in the development of an ââImpactability Scoreââ that uses administrative data to predict achievable savings.

        <p>
          Social care in Medicaid faces significant challenges, notably in securing sustainable funding for community health worker (CHW) programs. Discussions underscore the necessity of higher Medicaid funding to support these initiatives effectively. Regulatory complexities present barriers to implementing social care programs, leading to uncertainty and potential non-compliance among health plans. Clearer guidance from policymakers is advocated to mitigate these challenges and encourage the integration of social care services within Medicaid frameworks.

                <ul>
                  <li>Regulatory complexity is a major hurdle for social care programs. There are many different rules and requirements that health plans need to follow in order to offer social care services. These rules can be unclear and constantly changing, which makes it difficult for plans to know what is and is not allowed.</li>
                  <li>Uncertainty about compliance can lead to plans avoiding social care altogether. Because the rules are so complex and there is a risk of getting penalized for non-compliance, some health plans may decide not to offer social care services at all.</li>
                  <li>Clearer guidance from policymakers is needed. In order to encourage more health plans to offer social care services, policymakers need to provide clearer guidance on what is and is not allowed. This would help to reduce the risk of non-compliance and make it easier for plans to design and implement social care programs.</li>

        <p>

          FQHCs/Community Health Centers play a vital role in providing healthcare to vulnerable populations, often at little or no cost to patient. However, their participation in value-based payment models is hindered by funding and reimbursement challenges. Despite this, they demonstrate cost-efficient contributions to healthcare and are essential components of the social safety net. Understanding their economic impact, funding sources, and financial costs is crucial for optimizing their effectiveness. Additionally, community care hubs offer potential for enhancing health outcomes by centralizing administrative functions and fostering partnerships with community-based organizations. Clarifying Medicaid payment policies for FQHCs is essential for ensuring their sustainability and effectiveness in delivering care to underserved communities.

However, challenges arise, as seen in "As Medicaid Shrinks, Clinics for the Poor Are Trying to Survive," which discusses financial strains on clinics serving low-income populations due to shrinking enrollment. Articles on digital health solutions and innovative healthcare programs offer potential avenues to address Medicaid's complex needs. Understanding these trends is crucial for adapting healthcare delivery to meet the evolving needs of Medicaid beneficiaries effectively.

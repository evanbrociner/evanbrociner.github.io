                    <li>
                      <strong>Failing Nursing Home Industry:</strong>
                      The nursing home industry is failing to provide adequate care for its residents. This is caused by understaffing, low wages for nursing assistants, and a focus on profit over quality care. Residents are often neglected and may even be subjected to unnecessary medical treatments.</li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Problematic Assisted Living Facilities (ALFs):</strong>
                      Assisted living facilities (ALFs) are a less regulated alternative to nursing homes, but they also have problems. Many ALFs are not equipped to care for dementia patients, and there have been cases of residents being neglected or even abused.</li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Need for Home-Based Care:</strong>
                      There is a growing need for home-based care for the elderly and disabled. This would allow people to stay in their homes for as long as possible, but it requires reform at the national level to make it a viable option for more people.

                  Aledade partners with existing independent primary care practices to help them transition to value-based care.

                  KFF writes how Medicare Advantage plans are facing growing criticism from hospitals and doctors due to claim denials, preapproval hassles, and low reimbursement rates, leading to new regulations and potentially impacting patient choice.

              <h5>Key Points</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Hospitals and doctors are voicing frustrations with
                  <strong>Medicare Advantage plans</strong>. They cite
                  <strong>claim denials</strong>, burdensome preapproval processes, and inadequate reimbursement rates. This frustration is leading some providers to stop accepting certain Medicare Advantage plans.</li>
                <li>The Biden administration is
                  <strong>taking action</strong>
                  to address these concerns. New regulations aim to
                  <strong>restrict prior authorization</strong>
                  requirements and improve access to
                  <strong>necessary care</strong>
                  for patients.</li>
                <li>Increased scrutiny surrounds
                  <strong>Medicare Advantage plans</strong>, coming from both healthcare providers and lawmakers. This scrutiny is expected to persist as the federal government
                  <strong>implements new regulations</strong>.</li>

                  On Thursday, March 16, 2023, KFF hosted an hour-long web briefing focused on how state Medicaid programs are approaching this unwinding of the continuous enrollment provision. States’ existing enrollment and renewal procedures and their differing approaches to the unwinding will have major impacts on Medicaid enrollees, state spending, and broader health coverage trends.

                <li>
                  <b>Debate over how much Medicare pays Medicare Advantage plans:</b>
                  The federal government pays Medicare Advantage plans a fixed amount per beneficiary each month. There is disagreement about whether these payments are too high, with some arguing that Medicare Advantage plans are getting paid more than they should for the people they cover.</li>
                <li>
                  <b>Risk adjustment and coding:</b>
                  A key factor in how much Medicare Advantage plans are paid is a system called risk adjustment. This system takes into account the health status of enrollees, so that plans are paid more for sicker patients and less for healthier patients. Some argue that Medicare Advantage plans are reporting more diagnoses for their enrollees than traditional Medicare, which inflates their risk scores and leads to higher payments.</li>
                <li>
                  <b>Potential impact of proposed changes to payment system:</b>
                  The Biden Administration has proposed changes to the way Medicare Advantage plans are paid. These changes could reduce payments to plans by 3%. However, the impact on beneficiaries is uncertain. Some argue that plans will reduce benefits or increase premiums, while others argue that they will absorb the changes.</li>

                  In this article Phil Galewitz and Holly K. Hacker discusses the debate surrounding how much Medicare pays Medicare Advantage plans, including the risk adjustment system and potential effects of proposed payment changes.

              <h5>Key Points</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>CCM Benefits:</strong>
                  The Chronic Care Management program provides personalized care, regular touchpoints with healthcare providers, and coordinated care to Medicare enrollees with chronic conditions. This program helps keep patients out of the hospital and reduces unnecessary visits, potentially improving health outcomes.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Sluggish Participation:</strong>
                  Despite clear benefits, enrollment in the CCM program remains low. This is due to a variety of factors including the opt-in requirement for both patients and doctors, capacity limits for some medical practices, and the bureaucratic burdens of documentation and billing.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Outsourcing Solutions &amp; Financial Incentives:</strong>
                  Some medical practices outsource CCM services to companies, while others manage it in-house. The program offers additional income for providers, with Medicare paying an average of $62 per patient, per month, for the service. However, concerns exist about potentially unnecessary CCM enrollment for patients who don't fully need the service.</li>

                          <strong>Risk-based business models are gaining popularity:
                          </strong>Startups offering higher-touch care models that better manage chronic conditions are increasingly interested in taking on financial risk, as opposed to traditional fee-for-service payment models.</li>

                          <strong>Drivers of risk-based model adoption:</strong>
                          The success of existing examples, favorable government policies, increasing interest from private payers, and strong public market valuations are fueling growth in the risk-based healthcare space.

                          Businesses focused on high-cost patients (like those with chronic kidney disease), and those who can maintain long-term patient relationships are more likely to succeed, especially if they have a strong primary care presence for the patient.

                        <li>Defining quality metrics is key. How do we measure "value" in healthcare? Current metrics like readmission rates are important, but it's vital to find ones that directly measure quality of life improvements and aren't easily manipulated.</li>
                        <li>Overtreatment risk exists. Even in some value-based models like bundled payments, potential remains for providers to incentivize unnecessary procedures for financial gain. New quality metrics focused on "appropriate use" may be needed.</li>
                        <li>Value-based care can incentivize innovation. As providers take on more responsibility for patient outcomes, this model can fuel advancements in precision medicine, personalized treatments, and rethinking long-held medical practices to improve quality and reduce costs.</li>

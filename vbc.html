                    <b>Jacob Effron writes about how risk-based healthcare businesses are gaining momentum due to their potential to improve patient outcomes, lower costs, and attract investment, with success most likely for companies that focus on high-cost patients and long-term care relationships.</b>

                      <strong>Risk-based business models are gaining popularity:
                      </strong>Startups offering higher-touch care models that better manage chronic conditions are increasingly interested in taking on financial risk, as opposed to traditional fee-for-service payment models.</li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Drivers of risk-based model adoption:</strong>
                      The success of existing examples, favorable government policies, increasing interest from private payers, and strong public market valuations are fueling growth in the risk-based healthcare space.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Factors that influence success in risk-based models:</strong>
                      Businesses focused on high-cost patients (like those with chronic kidney disease), and those who can maintain long-term patient relationships are more likely to succeed, especially if they have a strong primary care presence for the patient.

                  <h5>Key Points</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Defining quality metrics is key. How do we measure "value" in healthcare? Current metrics like readmission rates are important, but it's vital to find ones that directly measure quality of life improvements and aren't easily manipulated.</li>
                    <li>Overtreatment risk exists. Even in some value-based models like bundled payments, potential remains for providers to incentivize unnecessary procedures for financial gain. New quality metrics focused on "appropriate use" may be needed.</li>
                    <li>Value-based care can incentivize innovation. As providers take on more responsibility for patient outcomes, this model can fuel advancements in precision medicine, personalized treatments, and rethinking long-held medical practices to improve quality and reduce costs.</li>

                      <strong>Risk Adjustment is Key for Value-Based Payment:</strong>
                      Risk adjustment models are crucial for the success of value-based payment (VBP) models. They compensate providers fairly by considering the varying health risks and expected costs of their patients.</li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Mitigating Market Failure:</strong>
                      Without risk adjustment, VBP models risk adverse selection where only high-risk patients remain in the system. Risk adjustment helps create balanced patient pools and ensures program viability.

                      Founders should carefully consider the right amount of risk for their business model (fee-for-service, subcapitation, or global capitation). A phased "glide path" to risk is often wise, building a strong foundation of outcomes data before taking on greater financial responsibility.

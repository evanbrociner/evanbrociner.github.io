    <h3>Section 1: Challenges and Opportunities in Medicaid Managed Care</h3>
    <p>Medicaid managed care aims to deliver comprehensive care for beneficiaries while controlling costs. However, it faces key challenges:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Identifying High-Need Patients:</b> Predictive models are emerging as a tool to pinpoint individuals who would benefit most from care management, like the "Impactability Score" developed by Community Care of North Carolina.

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Addressing Social Determinants of Health (SDOH):</b> Factors like housing, food insecurity, and transportation significantly impact health outcomes. Collaboration between managed care organizations and community-based organizations is crucial to address these needs.

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Engaging Beneficiaries:</b> Involving consumers in program design is vital for ensuring that programs meet community needs and are responsive to the unique experiences of the Medicaid population.

        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Despite these challenges, Medicaid managed care presents opportunities to improve care quality and cost-effectiveness through data analytics, preventive care, and consumer engagement.</p>

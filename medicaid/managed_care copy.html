          <p>Medicaid managed care should focus on developing predictive models to identify patients who will benefit most from care management and addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) like housing and food. It should invest in both medical and non-medical services for high-cost subgroups, involve consumers in program design to enhance engagement and meet community needs, and implement better predictive models and tailored interventions for super-utilizers. Effective strategies include structured follow-ups, preventive care, multidisciplinary teams, and data analytics. Integrated care approaches, such as those demonstrated by programs like CareMore, should be adopted to improve outcomes and cost-effectiveness by addressing social needs.

                  Care management of high-cost/high-needs patients is an increasingly common strategy to reduce health care costs. A variety of targeting methodologies have emerged to identify patients with high historical or predicted health care utilization, but the more pertinent question for program planners is how to identify those who are most likely to benefit from care management intervention. This paper describes the evolution of complex care management targeting strategies in Community Care of North Carolina’s (CCNC) work with the statewide non-dual Medicaid population, culminating in the development of an ‘‘Impactability Score’’ that uses administrative data to predict achievable savings.

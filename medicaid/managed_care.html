          <h1>Medicaid Managed Care</h1>

          <p>Medicaid managed care is a system in which states contract with managed care organizations (MCOs) to provide Medicaid benefits to enrollees. Instead of the traditional fee-for-service model, where healthcare providers are reimbursed for each service provided, managed care organizations receive a fixed monthly payment per enrollee to cover all of their healthcare needs.</p>

          <p>These managed care organizations are responsible for coordinating and delivering healthcare services to Medicaid beneficiaries within a defined network of healthcare providers. They often offer a range of services, including primary care, specialist care, hospitalization, and sometimes additional benefits like dental and vision care.</p>

          <p>Medicaid managed care aims to control costs, improve health outcomes, and provide more coordinated and comprehensive care for enrollees by encouraging preventive care and care management.</p>
          <p>Critiques I've heard in the past is that managed care is not necessarily the best way to care for patients, but as a way to have a more predictable budget for states. Managed care may also increase the administrative burden due to increased use of prior authorizations.</p>

          <h2>Making Managed Care Work</h2>

          <p>Medicaid managed care is undergoing a transformation, focusing on innovative approaches to enhance patient care and address social determinants of health (SDOH). Central to this evolution is the development of predictive models that can identify patients most likely to benefit from care management interventions
            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5906722/pdf/pop.2017.0122.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>. These models consider both medical and social factors, such as housing and food insecurity, to tailor interventions for high-cost subgroups
            <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/three-opportunities-address-social-drivers-health-medicaid-managed-care-environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a>,
            <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/dispelling-myths-hindering-medicaid-innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a>.</p>

          <p>A key emphasis is placed on addressing SDOH within the Medicaid managed care environment
            <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/three-opportunities-address-social-drivers-health-medicaid-managed-care-environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a>. This involves collaborations between Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) to provide comprehensive support for patients' social needs
            <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/three-opportunities-address-social-drivers-health-medicaid-managed-care-environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a>.</p>

          <p>To ensure the effectiveness of Medicaid programs, active engagement of consumers in program design is crucial
            <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0009.12492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[4]</a>. By incorporating patient perspectives, programs can better address community needs and increase engagement, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes
            <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0009.12492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[4]</a>,

          <h2>Integrated Care Models</h2>
          <p>For high-need, high-cost Medicaid patients, integrated care approaches like the CareMore model have shown promise
            <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/10/rethinking-how-medicaid-patients-receive-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[6]</a>,
            <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-to-improve-care-for-high-need-high-cost-medicaid-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[7]</a>. These models emphasize comprehensive, relationship-based primary care, collaborative behavioral health services, and a strong focus on addressing social needs
            <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/10/rethinking-how-medicaid-patients-receive-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[6]</a>. By breaking down silos between inpatient care and the community, such models aim to improve both the quality and cost-effectiveness of care for diverse populations
            <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/10/rethinking-how-medicaid-patients-receive-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[6]</a>.</p>

          <p>For high-need, high-cost Medicaid patients, integrated care models like the CareMore model (which Cityblock is similar to) show promise. These models prioritize comprehensive primary care, collaborative behavioral health services, and addressing social needs. They aim to improve both the quality and cost-effectiveness of care for diverse populations.</p>

          </a>
          <p>Cityblock's approach strongly emphasizes integrated care. Their care teams, comprising pharmacists, physicians, therapists, social workers, and more, work together to provide comprehensive care that addresses all aspects of a patient's health and well-being. This holistic approach aligns with the goals of integrated care models and has shown promising results in reducing hospitalizations and improving patient outcomes.</p>

          <h2>Programs for Super-Utilizers</h2>
          <p>Successful strategies for managing the cost of care include frequent, structured follow-ups, preventive care measures, multidisciplinary teams, and data analytics
            <a href="https://www.chcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PDF-ManagingCostofCare.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[8]</a>. Hospitalists, clinical pathways, bundled payments, and data-driven decision-making also play a crucial role in optimizing care delivery and reducing costs
            <a href="https://www.chcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PDF-ManagingCostofCare.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[8]</a>.</p>

          <p>In addition, innovative programs are being developed to better identify and address the needs of super-utilizers, who account for a disproportionate share of healthcare costs
            <a href="https://emergencymedicine.wustl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PGY-3-Johnson.-Many-Patients-Who-super-Use-Health-Care-Services-The-Need-Is-Intense-Yet-Temporary.-Health-Affairs.20115.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[9]</a>
          </p>

          <h2>Opportunities in Medicaid Managed Care</h2>
          <p>Overall, the future of Medicaid managed care lies in embracing a patient-centered approach, leveraging data analytics, addressing SDOH, and fostering collaboration between MCOs and CBOs. By implementing these strategies, Medicaid programs can achieve improved health outcomes, enhanced patient satisfaction, and greater cost-effectiveness.</p>
          <p>A key misconception is that Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) would prefer to recoup profits than invest in the care of their members. In reality, MCOs are incentivized to meet a minimum capital spending requirement on medical costs and actively seek solutions to improve care delivery and patient outcomes.</p>

          <p>For instance, given that seniors and persons with disabilities on Medicaid incur significantly higher costs compared to other covered groups, Medicaid plans would be more willing to invest in solutions targeted at this population. Entrepreneurs could then develop higher-cost, human-mediated, and tech-enabled services that cater to the specific care needs of this group. For lower-cost populations, such as children and adults without disabilities, entrepreneurs could develop telehealth, text message, and other software-mediated models for care delivery and management

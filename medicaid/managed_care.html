          <h1>Medicaid Managed Care 101</h1>
          <p>Managed care is highly prevalent in Medicaid, with the majority of Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans. As of fiscal year 2021, 72.4% of all Medicaid enrollees were in comprehensive managed care plans. The percentage of enrollees in these plans ranged from 36.8% for individuals aged 65 and older to 81.5% for the new adult group.

          </p>
          <p>More than two-thirds of all Medicaid beneficiaries nationally receive most or all of their care from risk-based managed care organizations (MCOs). A large and growing majority of state Medicaid programs contract with MCOs to deliver services. States are rapidly expanding their use of MCOs to serve more medically complex beneficiaries, deliver long-term services and supports, and cover newly eligible low-income adults under the Affordable Care Act.</p>
          <p>The prevalence of managed care in Medicaid has grown dramatically over the past two decades, with over 70% of Medicaid members currently enrolled in MCOs. States have increasingly turned to capitated managed care models where they pay MCOs a fixed per-member-per-month rate to provide comprehensive services to Medicaid enrollees.</p>
          <p>Medicaid managed care is a system in which states contract with managed care organizations (MCOs) to provide Medicaid benefits to enrollees. Instead of the traditional fee-for-service model, where healthcare providers are reimbursed for each service provided, managed care organizations receive a fixed monthly payment per enrollee to cover all of their healthcare needs.</p>

            <img alt="..." class="rounded mx-auto d-block" height="600" src="static/img/medicaid/why_managed_medicaid.jpeg" width="800"/>
          </div>
          <p>These managed care organizations are responsible for coordinating and delivering healthcare services to Medicaid beneficiaries within a defined network of healthcare providers. They often offer a range of services, including primary care, specialist care, hospitalization, and sometimes additional benefits like dental and vision care.</p>
          <p>Medicaid managed care aims to control costs, improve health outcomes, and provide more coordinated and comprehensive care for enrollees by encouraging preventive care and care management.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Critiques I've heard in the past is that managed care is not necessarily the best way to care for patients, but as a way to have a more predictable budget for states. Managed care may also increase the administrative burden due to increased use of prior authorizations.</p>

          <h2>Making Managed Care Work</h2>
          <p>The biggest challenge in Medicaid managed care is the high cost of care, which is partly due to increasing healthcare prices. To tackle this, new methods are being used to improve patient care and address social drivers of health health (SDOH). A key part of this is creating predictive models that find patients who would benefit most from care management
            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5906722/pdf/pop.2017.0122.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
              [4]</a>. These models look at both medical and social issues, like housing and food insecurity, to design better interventions for costly patient groups

              [6]</a>.
          </p>
          <p>Addressing SDOH is a major focus in Medicaid managed care
            <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/three-opportunities-address-social-drivers-health-medicaid-managed-care-environment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
              [5]</a>. This involves partnerships between Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) to fully support patients' social needs
            <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/three-opportunities-address-social-drivers-health-medicaid-managed-care-environment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">

          </p>
          <h2>Full-Risk Integrated Care Models</h2>
          <p>
            Integrated care models are basically a way of organizing healthcare to better address a patient's overall needs. Instead of having separate appointments for physical and mental health, for example, these models aim to bring different healthcare providers together to work as a team. This can improve communication and make it easier for patients to get the care they need.
          </p>
          <p>For high-need, high-cost Medicaid patients, integrated care approaches like the CareMore model have shown promise
            <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/10/rethinking-how-medicaid-patients-receive-care" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
              [7]</a>,
            <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-to-improve-care-for-high-need-high-cost-medicaid-patients" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
              [8]</a>. These models emphasize comprehensive, relationship-based primary care, collaborative behavioral health services, and a strong focus on addressing social needs
            <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/10/rethinking-how-medicaid-patients-receive-care" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
              [7]</a>. By breaking down silos between inpatient care and the community, such models aim to improve both the quality and cost-effectiveness of care for diverse populations
            <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/10/rethinking-how-medicaid-patients-receive-care" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
              [7]</a>.</p>
          <p>For high-need, high-cost Medicaid patients, integrated care models like the CareMore model (which Cityblock is similar to) show promise. These models prioritize comprehensive primary care, collaborative behavioral health services, and addressing social needs. They aim to improve both the quality and cost-effectiveness of care for diverse populations.</p>
          <div class="image-container">
            <img alt="..." class="rounded mx-auto d-block" height="200" src="static/img/medicaid/not_boring_VBC.webp" width="800"/>

            </a>
          </div>
          <p>Cityblock's approach strongly emphasizes integrated care. Their care teams, comprising pharmacists, physicians, therapists, social workers, and more, work together to provide comprehensive care that addresses all aspects of a patient's health and well-being. This holistic approach aligns with the goals of integrated care models and has shown promising results in reducing hospitalizations and improving patient outcomes.</p>
          <h2>Managed Care vs. Value-Based Care</h2>
          <p>Managed care and value-based care are related but not the same.</p>
          <p>Managed care organizations (MCOs) are increasingly incorporating value-based care principles into their contracts with providers. This means that MCOs are moving away from traditional fee-for-service payments and towards models that reward providers for delivering high-quality, efficient care.</p>
          <p>Managed care is a broad system of healthcare delivery focused on cost control, while value-based care is a specific model within managed care that prioritizes quality and outcomes. While not all managed care is value-based care, the two are increasingly intertwined as the healthcare industry shifts towards a greater emphasis on value.</p>
          <p>Capitated payments can be a useful tool within managed care to control costs and encourage efficient resource use. However, they are not a complete solution for achieving the goals of value-based care. By incorporating additional VBC incentives, managed care organizations can create payment models that better align the interests of providers with the goal of delivering high-quality, patient-centered care.</p>
          <h2>Super-Utilizers</h2>
          <p>Super-utilizers are patients who frequently use healthcare services, especially emergency departments and hospital admissions. They typically represent a small percentage of the patient population but account for a large portion of healthcare costs. Because they use healthcare services more frequently than other patients, they contribute disproportionately to healthcare expenses. Many super-utilizers suffer from multiple chronic conditions, mental health issues, or substance use disorders, which require ongoing and often intensive care.</p>
          <div class="image-container">
            <img alt="..." class="rounded mx-auto d-block" height="800" src="static/img/medicaid/hot_spotters.webp" width="800"/>
          </div>
          <p>Managing super-utilizers poses significant challenges. Their care needs are often complex, requiring coordination across multiple healthcare providers and services. Additionally, these patients often receive fragmented care, leading to repeated tests and procedures that drive up costs. Social determinants of health, such as housing instability and lack of access to nutritious food, further complicate their care and contribute to their high utilization of healthcare services.</p>
          <p>Successful strategies for managing the cost of care include frequent, structured follow-ups, preventive care measures, multidisciplinary teams, and data analytics
            <a href="https://www.chcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PDF-ManagingCostofCare.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
              [9]</a>. Hospitalists, clinical pathways, bundled payments, and data-driven decision-making also play a crucial role in optimizing care delivery and reducing costs
            <a href="https://www.chcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PDF-ManagingCostofCare.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">

          https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5215147/

          <p>In addition, innovative programs are being developed to better identify and address the needs of super-utilizers, who account for a disproportionate share of healthcare costs
            <a href="https://emergencymedicine.wustl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PGY-3-Johnson.-Many-Patients-Who-super-Use-Health-Care-Services-The-Need-Is-Intense-Yet-Temporary.-Health-Affairs.20115.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">

          </p>
          <h2>Opportunities in Medicaid Managed Care</h2>
          <p>The future of Medicaid managed care is focused on bending the cost curve
            <a href="https://www.outofpocket.health/p/pitching-to-payers-pilots-and-what-makes-blue-cross-distinct-with-tricia-garland" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
              [11]</a>. From a healthcare point of view this includes focusing on patient's sub-group needs, using data analytics, addressing social factors affecting health, and encouraging cooperation between MCOs and CBOs. These strategies can ideally lead to better health outcomes, higher patient satisfaction, and more cost-effective programs.</p>
          <p>For example, seniors and people with disabilities on Medicaid have much higher healthcare costs than other groups. Therefore, Medicaid plans are more likely to invest in solutions for this population. Healthcare builders can develop more expensive, human-assisted, and tech-enabled services for them. For lower-cost groups, such as children and adults without disabilities, healthcare builders can create telehealth, text messaging, and other software-based care models.
            <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/dispelling-myths-hindering-medicaid-innovation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
              [6]</a>
          </p>
          <p>A common misconception is that MCOs prefer to save money rather than invest in their members' care. In reality, MCOs are required to spend a minimum amount on medical costs and actively look for ways to improve care and patient outcomes.
          </p>
          <h2>Systemic Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            Shortage of healthcare providers and low payment rates from Medicaid. This makes many providers choose not to see Medicaid patients because it’s not financially sustainable for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my view, the real change in Medicaid will come from policy. Not necessarily policy that will improve Medicaid, but policy that will address economic inequality in America.
          </p>
          <p>
            While there will be companies that can improve the care of those on Medicaid, we need systemic changes in America for things such as housing, wages, and community to see true improvement.

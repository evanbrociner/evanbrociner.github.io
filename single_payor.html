                                                    government is too corrupt
                                                    for such a system to be
                                                    successful.</li>
<li>He instead proposes a system
                                                    similar to the Affordable
                                                    Care Act, with

<h5>Key Points</h5>
<ul>
<li>Economists believe that
                                                    wages are lower to offset
                                                    the cost of
                                                    employer-provided health
                                                    insurance.</li>
<li>There is a debate on whether
                                                    Medicare for All would cause
                                                    wages to rise.</li>
<li>Some studies suggest that
                                                    wages would rise by the same
                                                    amount as the reduction in
                                                    employer health insurance
                                                    costs.</li>

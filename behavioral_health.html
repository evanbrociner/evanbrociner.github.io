              </td>
              <td>After more than a decade of stability or improvement, the mental health of adolescents plunged in the early 2010s. Rates of depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicide rose sharply, more than doubling on many measures. Why? In The Anxious Generation, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt lays out the facts about the epidemic of teen mental illness that hit many countries at the same time. He then investigates the nature of childhood, including why children need play and independent exploration to mature into competent, thriving adults.</td>

                  <b>Susan Inman highlights in her article the systemic challenges faced by families of individuals with schizophrenia, including inadequate education, anti-psychiatry influences, and the limitations of the recovery model.</p>

                <h5>Key Points</h5>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Lack of Educational Resources:</strong>
                    There's a lack of public mental health education and adequate psycho-education for those with mental illnesses. This leads to delayed treatment, stigma, and misunderstanding of conditions like schizophrenia.</li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Influence of Anti-Psychiatry Beliefs:</strong>
                    The anti-psychiatry movement can be harmful. It downplays the severity of some mental illnesses, promotes distrust in medical treatments, and undermines the vital role of medication.</li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>The Recovery Model's Limitations:</strong>
                    While the recovery model has positive aspects, it can sometimes minimize the reality that some individuals may never fully recover. This creates unrealistic expectations and downplays the ongoing need for support and medical treatment for severe mental illnesses.</li>

                    <strong>Loneliness as a Health Threat:</strong>
                    Prolonged loneliness acts as a biological stressor, negatively impacting our physical health and increasing our risk of chronic diseases and even early death.

                  <li>
                    <strong>The Loneliness Epidemic Exacerbated:</strong>
                    The United States was already facing a loneliness epidemic prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic restrictions further isolated people, worsening feelings of loneliness and mental health.

                    <strong>The Need to Restructure Society:</strong>
                    Individual treatment for loneliness isn't enough. To truly address the issue, we need a societal shift that prioritizes social connection and recognizes its profound impact on well-being.</li>

                  Male Suicide: Patterns and Recent Trends</a>
              </td>
              <td>
                This brief summarizes key facts and trends concerning male suicide. It includes a snapshot of male suicide in 2022, including breakdowns by age, race, and geography. We also explore the rise in male suicide rates since 1999, with a focus on trends by age. We find that earlier in the 2000s, growth in suicide was driven by middle aged men, but since 2010 it has been driven by younger men. The mental health crisis among young women and men, especially, is being manifested in importantly different ways, with higher rates of attempted suicide and suicidality among girls and women. Understanding these risks, not least of which is male suicide, and how they are changing over time, is important not only for policymakers and health professionals, but also for parents, teachers, and the general public.

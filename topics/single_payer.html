                                                The success of Democrats in
                                                the 2018 congressional
                                                elections and their unified

                                                have bolstered the

                                                This shift raises questions

                                            <li>Uwe Reinhardt was a famous
                                                healthcare economist who
                                                made significant
                                                contributions to the field.
                                                He is best known for his
                                                work on healthcare economics
                                                in the United States and

                                            <li>Reinhardt's book <em>Priced
                                                    Out</em> discusses the
                                                reasons for high healthcare
                                                costs in the United States.
                                                He argues that the primary
                                                reason is the high prices of

                                                believes that the U.S.
                                                government is too corrupt
                                                for such a system to be

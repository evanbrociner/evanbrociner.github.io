                          their potential to improve patient outcomes, lower costs, and attract investment, with success
                          most likely for companies that focus on high-cost patients and long-term care

                          <strong>Risk-based business models are gaining popularity:
                          </strong>Startups offering higher-touch care models that better manage chronic conditions are
                          increasingly interested in taking on financial risk, as opposed to traditional fee-for-service
                          payment models.

                        <li>
                          <strong>Drivers of risk-based model adoption:</strong>
                          The success of existing examples, favorable government policies, increasing interest from
                          private payers, and strong public market valuations are fueling growth in the risk-based
                          healthcare space.

                          <strong>Factors that influence success in risk-based models:</strong>
                          Businesses focused on high-cost patients (like those with chronic kidney disease), and those
                          who can maintain long-term patient relationships are more likely to succeed, especially if
                          they have a strong primary care presence for the patient.

                        <b>Maitreyee Joshi talks about how value based care models aim to shift healthcare focus from
                          volume of services to quality of patient outcomes, but their success hinges on careful design
                          to ensure accurate metrics, prevent unintended consequences, and avoid providers gaming the
                          system.

                      <h5>Key Points</h5>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Defining quality metrics is key. How do we measure "value" in healthcare? Current metrics
                          like readmission rates are important, but it's vital to find ones that directly measure
                          quality of life improvements and aren't easily manipulated.</li>
                        <li>Overtreatment risk exists. Even in some value-based models like bundled payments, potential
                          remains for providers to incentivize unnecessary procedures for financial gain. New quality
                          metrics focused on "appropriate use" may be needed.</li>
                        <li>Value-based care can incentivize innovation. As providers take on more responsibility for
                          patient outcomes, this model can fuel advancements in precision medicine, personalized
                          treatments, and rethinking long-held medical practices to improve quality and reduce costs.

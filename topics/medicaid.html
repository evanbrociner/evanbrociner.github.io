              programs like CareMore, should be adopted to improve outcomes and cost-effectiveness by addressing

                    Care management of high-cost/high-needs patients is an increasingly common strategy to reduce
                    health
                    care costs. A variety of targeting methodologies have emerged to identify patients with high
                    historical or predicted health care utilization, but the more pertinent question for program
                    planners
                    is how to identify those who are most likely to benefit from care management intervention. This

                      This article explores how Medicaid managed care programs can better address social factors
                      that
                      influence health outcomes. It argues that collaboration between Medicaid managed care
                      organizations
                      and community-based organizations is essential to meet patients' social needs.

                      <li>Traditional Medicaid care models often create silos, isolating patients during
                        hospitalization
                        and making it difficult to manage their health after discharge.</li>
                      <li>CareMore, a health plan, focuses on actively managing Medicaid patients during
                        hospitalization
                        and the crucial period immediately following discharge.</li>
                      <li>This integrated approach includes strategies like addressing food insecurity, providing
                        in-home
                        care, and offering behavioral health services for substance abuse.</li>
                      <li>The goal is to prove that improved Medicaid managed care can significantly enhance the
                        quality
                        and cost-effectiveness of care for various populations.
                      </li>
                      <li>The key lies in designing care models that specifically
                        <b>address the unique needs of the Medicaid population.</b>

            <p>Social care in Medicaid faces significant challenges, notably in securing sustainable funding for
              community health worker (CHW) programs. Discussions underscore the necessity of higher Medicaid funding to
              support these initiatives effectively. Regulatory complexities present barriers to implementing social
              care programs, leading to uncertainty and potential non-compliance among health plans. Clearer guidance
              from policymakers is advocated to mitigate these challenges and encourage the integration of social care
              services within Medicaid frameworks.</p>

                        <strong>Failing Nursing Home Industry:</strong>
                        The nursing home industry is failing to provide adequate care for its
                        residents. This is caused by understaffing, low wages for nursing
                        assistants, and a focus on profit over quality care. Residents are often
                        neglected and may even be subjected to unnecessary medical treatments.

                        Assisted living facilities (ALFs) are a less regulated alternative to
                        nursing homes, but they also have problems. Many ALFs are not equipped
                        to care for dementia patients, and there have been cases of residents
                        being neglected or even abused.

                        This would allow people to stay in their homes for as long as possible,
                        but it requires reform at the national level to make it a viable option
                        for more people.

                        Medicare ceases to operate, but there will be a shortfall between

                        <strong>Medicare Advantage Limitations:</strong>
                        Despite its supposed benefits like capitation and value-based care,
                        has limitations. These limitations include potential overpayments,
                        cherry-picking healthy patients, and squeezing specialists with
                        lower pay.

                        <strong>"Making Care Primary" (MCP) as an Improvement:</strong>
                        MCP is a potential improvement over MA. MCP focuses on better
                        coordination between primary and specialist care and creates a
                        pathway for integrating specialist care within advanced primary
                        care models.

                        <strong>Potential of MCP:</strong>
                        MCP could address specialist care limitations by creating incentives
                        for Advanced Primary Care (APC) practices to manage specialist
                        care in-house. This could involve hiring specialists, partnering
                        with next-generation specialists, or developing microcenters

                        While mega trends (like the aging population) indicate large-scale
                        problems, they don't automatically translate to a viable business.
                        Entrepreneurs must go beyond the obvious and identify specific pain

                        <b>Debate over how much Medicare pays Medicare Advantage plans:</b>
                        The federal government pays Medicare Advantage plans a fixed amount per
                        beneficiary each month. There is disagreement about whether these
                        payments are too high, with some arguing that Medicare Advantage plans
                        are getting paid more than they should for the people they cover.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Risk adjustment and coding:</b>
                        A key factor in how much Medicare Advantage plans are paid is a system
                        called risk adjustment. This system takes into account the health status
                        of enrollees, so that plans are paid more for sicker patients and less
                        for healthier patients. Some argue that Medicare Advantage plans are
                        reporting more diagnoses for their enrollees than traditional Medicare,
                        which inflates their risk scores and leads to higher payments.

                        <b>Potential impact of proposed changes to payment system:</b>
                        The Biden Administration has proposed changes to the way Medicare
                        Advantage plans are paid. These changes could reduce payments to plans
                        by 3%. However, the impact on beneficiaries is uncertain. Some argue
                        that plans will reduce benefits or increase premiums, while others argue
                        that they will absorb the changes.

                        In this article Phil Galewitz and Holly K. Hacker discusses the debate
                        surrounding how much Medicare pays Medicare Advantage plans, including
                        the risk adjustment system and potential effects of proposed payment

                        <strong>CCM Benefits:</strong>
                        The Chronic Care Management program provides personalized care, regular
                        touchpoints with healthcare providers, and coordinated care to Medicare
                        enrollees with chronic conditions. This program helps keep patients out
                        of the hospital and reduces unnecessary visits, potentially improving
                        health outcomes.

                      <li>
                        <strong>Sluggish Participation:</strong>
                        Despite clear benefits, enrollment in the CCM program remains low. This
                        is due to a variety of factors including the opt-in requirement for
                        both patients and doctors, capacity limits for some medical practices,
                        and the bureaucratic burdens of documentation and billing.

                      <li>
                        <strong>Outsourcing Solutions &amp; Financial Incentives:</strong>
                        Some medical practices outsource CCM services to companies, while others
                        manage it in-house. The program offers additional income for providers,
                        with Medicare paying an average of $62 per patient, per month, for the
                        service. However, concerns exist about potentially unnecessary CCM
                        enrollment for patients who don't fully need the service.

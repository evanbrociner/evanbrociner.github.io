                                                are middlemen hired by insurance
                                                companies to negotiate drug
                                                prices and manage prescription
                                                benefits. They often receive
                                                rebates from pharmaceutical
                                                companies in exchange for
                                                favorable placement of drugs on
                                                formularies.</li>
                                            <li>PBMs engage in practices that
                                                drive up drug costs, such as
                                                creating fake prices and
                                                charging patients more than the
                                                actual cost of drugs. They also
                                                use tactics like retroactive
                                                audits and clawbacks to harm
                                                independent pharmacies.</li>
                                            <li>The PBM industry is highly
                                                concentrated, with three major
                                                PBMs controlling a large portion
                                                of the market. This lack of
                                                competition allows PBMs to
                                                engage in anti-competitive
                                                practices and further inflate

                                                of money. For example, they

                                                overpriced supplies.

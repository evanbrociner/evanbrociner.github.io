                    <li>Integrated model for addressing medical and social risk: Augment existing integrated-care models with increased staffing, resources, and protocols to identify and manage social risk.</li>
                    <li>Focus on the most relevant drivers of poor outcomes: Identify the unique drivers of poor outcomes for each individual patient and pay specific attention to the drivers that matter most to patients and those that can be addressed over the following weeks to months.</li>
                    <li>Partner with community-based organizations and social-safety-net institutions: Build trusting, longitudinal relationships with organizations in the community to facilitate rapid intervention and support.</li>

                    <li>This integrated approach includes strategies like addressing food insecurity, providing in-home care, and offering behavioral health services for substance abuse.</li>
                    <li>The goal is to prove that improved Medicaid managed care can significantly enhance the quality and cost-effectiveness of care for various populations.
                    </li>

                  <p>The article describes a care management program implemented by Mass General Brigham, a large healthcare system. The program uses a multidimensional approach to assess patients’ needs and match them to the most appropriate care program. The goal is to provide the right care to the right patient at the right time.</p>

                  <h5>Key Points</h5>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Multidimensional assessment: Patients are assessed on a variety of factors, including their medical conditions, social determinants of health, and behavioral health needs. This helps to ensure that care plans are tailored to the individual needs of each patient.
                    </li>
                    <li>Stratification of care: Patients are then stratified into different care programs based on their needs. For example, patients with complex medical conditions may be assigned to a care program that provides more intensive care management, while patients with less complex needs may be assigned to a program that provides more self-management support.
                    </li>
                    <li>Care management: Care managers work with patients to develop and implement their care plans. They also provide ongoing support and monitoring to help patients stay on track with their goals.
                    </li>
                    <li>Data-driven decision making: The program uses data to track patient outcomes and identify areas for improvement. This data is used to inform the development and refinement of the care programs.
